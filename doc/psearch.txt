1. Overview                                                 *psearch-overview*

This plugin shows a preview of all the lines where your search pattern matches
in the current file. 

Execute the `:PSearch` command and type something. You'll see a preview 
of all the lines where the pattern you gave matches in the currently 
opened buffers.

Below there is list of all the mappings you can use to interact with the window:

    * UP, CTRL+K: move up in the list.

    * DOWN, CTRL+J: move down in the list.

    * CTRL+B: move to the bottom of the list.

    * CTRL+T: move to the top of the list.

    * LEFT, RIGHT: move across previews of matches in other buffers.

    * RETURN, CTRL+G: go to the selected match.

    * ESC, CTRL+C: close the matches list.

You are allowed to use any pattern that would work with the `/` and
`?` vim commands. Note that you have to write the pattern as the `nomagic`
option would be set.
