### Overview

This plugin shows a preview of all the lines where your search
pattern matches in the currently opened buffers. 

![Screenshot](/extra/screenshot.png "A view of the plugin at work")  

Execute the `:PSearch` command and type something. You'll see a preview 
of all the lines where the pattern you gave matches in the currently 
opened buffers.

Below there is list of all the mappings you can use to interact with the window:

* `UP`, `CTRL+K`: move up in the list.
* `DOWN`, `CTRL+J`: move down in the list.
* `CTRL+B`: move to the bottom of the list.
* `CTRL+T`: move to the top of the list.
* `LEFT` or `CTRL+H`, `RIGHT` or `CTRL+L`: move across lists of matches of other buffers.
* `RETURN`, `CTRL+G`: go to the selected match.
* `CTRL+A`: show jump marks for each result.
* `ESC`, `CTRL+C`: close the matches list.

You are allowed to use any pattern that would work with the `/` and
`?` vim commands and as the `nomagic` option would be set.

Pressing `CTRL+A` in the psearch navigation buffer will add jump marks denoted
in the format `<[a-z]>` for each search result entry. When the marks have been
displayed entering any of the letters used as mark will jump directly to the
respective entry and close the search navigation. Entering any letter that is
not a mark will discard the action.
